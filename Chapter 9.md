## 9. Future Enhancements

`sched_ext` is a groundbreaking framework that brings programmability and flexibility to Linux scheduling. While it is already powerful, there are several avenues for future improvements that can make it even more robust and versatile.

### 9.1 Integration with Kernel Scheduler Improvements

As the Linux kernel evolves, sched_ext can benefit from tighter integration with core scheduler enhancements:

- **CFS and Real-Time Scheduler Improvements:**  
  Improvements in the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) and real-time scheduling paths could be exposed to BPF schedulers, allowing hybrid approaches where sched_ext leverages kernel optimizations while applying custom policies.

- **Better Metrics and Tracing:**  
  Integration with existing kernel tracing tools (ftrace, perf, BPF tracepoints) can provide richer, low-overhead metrics to sched_ext, enabling more accurate scheduling decisions.

- **Lock-Free and Low-Latency Primitives:**  
  Upcoming kernel primitives for low-latency task insertion and dispatch could be leveraged by sched_ext to further reduce scheduling overhead.

- **Improved CPU Affinity Handling:**  
  As the kernel adds new NUMA-aware or heterogeneous CPU features, sched_ext can adapt dynamically to improve locality and reduce migration costs.

### 9.2 Potential for Hybrid Schedulers

Hybrid schedulers combine the best of multiple scheduling approaches. sched_ext offers a platform to explore these models safely:

- **BPF + Fair Scheduler Hybrid:**  
  Allow certain workloads to continue using CFS while others are handled by sched_ext, optimizing for both fairness and specialized policies.

- **Energy-Aware Scheduling:**  
  Integrate energy consumption data with sched_ext to dynamically migrate tasks or consolidate workloads on fewer cores to reduce power usage.

- **Machine Learning Assisted Scheduling:**  
  Use historical metrics collected in BPF maps to train models that predict task behavior and optimize scheduling in real-time.

- **Domain-Specific Schedulers:**  
  For AI/ML, multimedia, or networking workloads, hybrid schedulers can implement multiple DSQs and policies tailored to each domain, improving responsiveness and throughput.

- **Adaptive Scheduling Policies:**  
  Policies that adapt dynamically based on system load, task characteristics, and priorities, ensuring consistent performance across varying workloads.

✅ **Summary:**  
The future of sched_ext is promising, with opportunities to:

- Leverage kernel improvements for performance and stability.  
- Implement hybrid scheduling strategies tailored to diverse workloads.  
- Integrate energy-aware and machine learning–based decision-making.  
- Enable domain-specific optimizations without compromising system safety.

By exploring these enhancements, sched_ext can evolve from a flexible experimental scheduler to a mainstream, production-ready framework capable of handling the demands of next-generation computing systems.

## 8. Best Practices

`sched_ext` provides a powerful, flexible framework for implementing custom scheduling policies using BPF. To ensure optimal performance, stability, and maintainability, it is important to follow best practices.

### 8.1 Choosing a Scheduler Policy

Selecting the right policy for your workload is crucial:

- **Workload Characterization:**  
  Identify whether tasks are latency-sensitive, compute-intensive, I/O-bound, or heterogeneous. This guides whether you prioritize local DSQs, global DSQs, or custom task queues.

- **Policy Granularity:**  
  Use BPF maps and DSQs to separate tasks by priority, tenant, or function. For example:  
  - Real-time audio streams → high-priority DSQ  
  - Background batch jobs → low-priority DSQ  

- **Fallback Strategy:**  
  Even when using complex policies, ensure tasks can safely fall back to the default fair scheduler in case of errors or unexpected behavior.

- **Dynamic Adjustments:**  
  Policies should be adaptable to changing system loads. Consider dynamic rebalancing of CPU shares or DSQs based on real-time metrics.

### 8.2 Avoiding Resource Contention

Contention occurs when multiple tasks compete for the same CPU resources or DSQs. Minimizing contention improves latency and throughput:

- **CPU Affinity and Pinning:**  
  Assign tasks or DSQs to specific CPUs to reduce migration overhead and cache invalidation.

- **DSQ Separation:**  
  Avoid mixing high-latency tasks with low-latency tasks in the same DSQ. This prevents critical tasks from being delayed by background workloads.

- **Limit Preemption:**  
  Only preempt tasks when necessary to maintain fairness or meet deadlines. Excessive preemption increases context-switch overhead.

- **Quota Enforcement:**  
  For multi-tenant systems, enforce per-tenant CPU quotas using BPF maps and DSQs to prevent noisy neighbors from dominating resources.

### 8.3 Monitoring and Maintenance

Regular monitoring ensures that the scheduler operates as intended and that anomalies are detected early:

- **Tracepoints and Debugging:**  
  Use `sched_ext_dump` tracepoints and SysRq-D to collect detailed debugging information without stopping the scheduler.

- **Metrics Collection:**  
  Continuously monitor key performance indicators such as latency, throughput, CPU utilization, and DSQ occupancy.

- **Fallback Readiness:**  
  Keep an eye on tasks or DSQs that may be stalled. The BPF scheduler automatically reverts to the fair scheduler on detecting deadlocks or stalled tasks, but manual intervention may be required in complex scenarios.

- **Periodic Validation:**  
  Use scripts like `scx_show_state.py` to check scheduler status, active DSQs, and task mappings. Confirm that the policies are performing as expected.

- **Logging and Alerts:**  
  Capture events such as failed task insertions, preemption anomalies, or unexpected CPU migrations. Set up alerts for unusual metrics spikes to prevent performance degradation.

✅ **Summary:**  
Following these best practices ensures that `sched_ext` is used safely and effectively:

- Select policies aligned with workload characteristics.  
- Minimize contention with careful DSQ design and CPU affinity.  
- Continuously monitor system metrics and maintain fallback mechanisms.  

By adhering to these practices, developers and researchers can harness the full potential of `sched_ext` while maintaining system stability and performance.
